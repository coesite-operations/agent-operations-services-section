/**
 * @description Hands a seated task to a seated office by raising a dispatch — the record make-a-task.js points at when it says who the task is handed to belongs to the dispatch, never to the record. Refuses a task that seats nowhere, an office that seats in no roster, and a second dispatch of a task already dispatched. Use after raising a task, to put it on the board; a dispatch is open while the task's goal is unachieved, and openness is a readout, never a field.
 * @throws {Error} The intake must name a task and an office.
 * @throws {Error} The task must seat in the tasks pool.
 * @throws {Error} The office must seat in a roster somewhere in the tree.
 * @throws {Error} No seated dispatch may already name this task.
 * @throws {Error} No dispatch of this id may already be seated.
 *
 * A dispatch record exists that conforms to emsenn/schema/dispatch — task,
 * office, and nothing else of substance. Openness is derivable by
 * re-running the task's goal and is asserted nowhere in the record.
 *
 * A dispatch is the hand-off: a seated task, joined to the office that will
 * answer for it.
 *
 * The vocabulary is exact, because each record carries one thing and the
 * dispatch is what joins them:
 *
 *   - The TASK carries the goal — commands a machine runs, so the work can fail.
 *   - The DUTY carries the obligation — it stands, and the task discharges
 *     against it.
 *   - The OFFICE carries the answering-for — it outlives whoever holds it.
 *   - The DISPATCH is only the fact that a task and an office were joined,
 *     which is why it holds nothing else of substance.
 *
 * It is handed to an office, never to a person, for the charter's reason
 * exactly: handed to a person it dies with the person. Handed to a session,
 * it dies with the context window.
 *
 * ## Openness is a readout
 *
 * A dispatch is OPEN while the dispatched task's goal is unachieved, and that
 * is derived, never recorded: re-run the goal — `make-a-task.js --verify
 * <task>` — and the board is the truth. The record has no status field, no
 * open key, no closed key, and this is the same rule as the task's: a
 * dispatch that could assert its own closure would be the worker marking the
 * board instead of the goal marking it. The query that reads the whole board
 * this way is `list-open-obligations.js`, under
 * fulfilling-the-obligations-of-an-office.
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * echo '{"id":"…","task":"<task-id>","office":"<office-id>"}' \
 *   | node .../dispatch-a-task.js
 *
 * node .../dispatch-a-task.js --read <id>
 * node .../dispatch-a-task.js --list
 * ```
 *
 * Input is JSON. Output is JSON. `id` defaults to the task's id — one task,
 * one dispatch, so the task's name is usually the dispatch's.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why that is the skill
 *
 * Emitting a dispatch is trivial; what makes it a hand-off rather than a
 * wish is that both ends exist and no other hand holds the same task:
 *
 * - **A task that seats nowhere** — refused. Dispatching it hands an office
 *   nothing and leaves it answering for it anyway. Raise the task first
 *   (making-a-task); a dispatch hands over what exists.
 * - **An office that seats in no roster** — refused. A dispatch to nobody is
 *   the operator keeping the work, with a record saying otherwise.
 * - **A second dispatch of a task already dispatched** — refused, both named.
 *   Two dispatches of one task is two offices answering for one goal — a
 *   contradiction to name, not a queue to append to.
 * - **A dispatch id already seated** — refused, never overwritten.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not to raise the task — that is making-a-task. This hands over what
 *   already seats.
 * - Not to record that dispatched work is done. There is nothing to record:
 *   the goal settles it, and the witness re-runs it (attesting-a-work-product).
 * - Not to reassign a task. A dispatch is not amended; the contradiction of
 *   a second dispatch is deliberate. If the hand-off was wrong, that is a
 *   decision for the offices, taken where decisions are recorded — not a
 *   field to overwrite.
