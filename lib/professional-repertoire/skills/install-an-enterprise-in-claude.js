/**
 * @description Installs a whole enterprise into a node: every office seated in the enterprise's offices/ roster is installed as a subagent by calling installing-claude-as-an-agent once per office, and a generated standing block is spliced into <node>/CLAUDE.md between its markers so a fresh session at that node knows, with no other context, to delegate work to those offices and to run the obligation loop. Refuses an enterprise path holding no offices/ directory, an empty roster, a root that does not contain the enterprise, a torn marker pair, a roster record that yields no description, and a cited instrument that seats nowhere; a sibling installer's failure kills the install with its stderr shown and the offices already installed recorded in the manifest, so no partial success is reported as success and --clean can sweep the residue. Use to stand a node up as an enterprise's dispatcher; use the two sibling installers to seat one office; never edit the block by hand — CLAUDE.md between the markers is output, regenerated on the next install.
 * @param {string} root - (default: the working directory) Must contain the enterprise, so every path the block cites renders true.
 * @param {string} authority-root - Explicitly names the git worktree whose operated scope contains both the source enterprise and target node without crossing a checked-out submodule boundary.
 * @throws {Error} The enterprise path must hold an offices/ directory — its absence is an absence, not an empty enterprise.
 * @throws {Error} The roster must seat at least one office, each id in exactly one of the three record shapes.
 * @throws {Error} The node must exist and be a directory.
 * @throws {Error} The sibling installer must seat beside this script, or in the lib/management/skills pool of a unit at or above a projected copy.
 * @throws {Error} Every instrument the block cites must seat in the enterprise's skills pool.
 * @throws {Error} Every roster record must yield a first sentence for its roster line.
 * @throws {Error} The node's CLAUDE.md, when present, must hold both markers or neither — a torn pair is refused.
 *
 * Once installed: every roster office is installed as an agent at the node
 * by the sibling installer, under its manifest discipline. The node's
 * CLAUDE.md holds the generated block between the markers, byte-identical
 * to the projection, read back and checked. The rest of the node's
 * CLAUDE.md outside the markers is byte-identical to what was there
 * before, and clean restores it byte-identically, guided by the splice
 * mode the manifest records. The node's enterprise manifest records each
 * office as it installs, and the block's splice mode, so clean is exact
 * even after a mid-roster failure.
 *
 * An enterprise install is the third relation between an office and a node.
 * installing-claude-as-an-office seats one office as the identity a node's
 * sessions step into; installing-claude-as-an-agent seats one office as a
 * colleague a session hands work to. This skill seats the WHOLE ROSTER as
 * colleagues, and teaches the node's own sessions what to do with them: the
 * session at an enterprise node holds no office itself — it is the
 * dispatcher, and the standing block in its CLAUDE.md is the whole of its
 * standing instruction.
 *
 * The block is a deterministic projection of the enterprise's pools — same
 * enterprise, same root, same block, from any working directory, because
 * every path it cites renders relative to a root that is checked to contain
 * the enterprise. It fabricates no roster fact: the office that attestation
 * belongs to is read from the roster (the bearer of attesting-a-work-product),
 * and an enterprise that seats no such office is told exactly that — the
 * operator is the witness. The instruments it cites are cited with the
 * enterprise's own pools passed explicitly, so the commands are true for a
 * non-default enterprise, not only for the one this repository grew first.
 *
 * The agents are not installed here; they are installed by the sibling,
 * called once per office and never copied — found beside this script in the
 * flat pool, or by walking up to the lib/management/skills pool of the unit
 * a projected copy seats under. Its refusals are this skill's refusals,
 * propagated uncensored, and a mid-roster failure stops the install with
 * everything already installed recorded in the enterprise manifest, so
 * --clean sweeps the residue rather than stranding it.
 *
 * ## One block, both markers
 *
 * The block lands in <node>/CLAUDE.md between
 * `<!-- installing-an-enterprise-in-claude: begin -->` and its end marker.
 * A file that does not exist is created holding only the block; a file
 * holding both markers has the block replaced in place, byte-exact, the
 * rest untouched; a file holding neither gets the block appended after one
 * separator newline. Which of the three happened is recorded in the
 * manifest as the block's splice mode, and clean undoes exactly that —
 * the separator is removed only when the splice added it, a created file
 * left holding nothing is removed, and a block spliced between pre-existing
 * markers is excised without touching a byte on either side. A file holding
 * ONE marker is a torn block — a contradiction to name, not a thing to
 * repair silently — and is refused.
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * node .../install-an-enterprise-in-claude.js [<enterprise>] [<node>] --root <repo-root> --authority-root <git-worktree-root>
 * node .../install-an-enterprise-in-claude.js <enterprise> <node> --list --root <repo-root> --authority-root <git-worktree-root>
 * node .../install-an-enterprise-in-claude.js <enterprise> <node> --dry-run --root <repo-root> --authority-root <git-worktree-root>
 * node .../install-an-enterprise-in-claude.js <enterprise> <node> --clean --root <repo-root> --authority-root <git-worktree-root>
 * node .../install-an-enterprise-in-claude.js <enterprise> <node> --reinstall --root <repo-root> --authority-root <git-worktree-root>
 * ```
 * Every form also requires `--authority-root <git-worktree-root>`; it is
 * deliberately not defaulted from `--root`, because omission is not consent.
 *
 * <enterprise> is the enterprise's management library — a directory holding
 * an offices/ pool, with duties/, works/ and skills/ expected beside it —
 * defaulting to <node>/lib/management. <node> is the directory whose
 * sessions receive the enterprise, defaulting to the working directory.
 * Installs are recorded in <node>/.claude/.claude-enterprise-manifest, each
 * office as it installs, so that --clean is exact: it removes the block by
 * the recorded splice mode (the rest of the file byte-identical), delegates
 * --clean per manifest office to the sibling — or, for an office whose
 * record no longer seats in the roster, performs the sibling's exact
 * inverse here and says so, since the sibling refuses to resolve a record
 * that is gone — and removes the manifest. A manifest-less clean reports
 * that there is nothing to clean, which is a report, not an error; a dry
 * run of clean says what it would do, never that it did.
 *
 * Known limit, stated rather than hidden: a manifest written before the
 * splice mode was recorded carries a bare `CLAUDE.md` line, and clean
 * degrades it to in-place — the non-destructive default, which touches no
 * byte outside the markers. An old separator-mode install cleaned through
 * such a manifest therefore leaves its one separator newline behind rather
 * than risk eating a byte that was never this mechanism's.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why that is the skill
 *
 * - **No offices/ at the enterprise path** — refused. That is an absence,
 *   not an empty enterprise; installing from it would invent a roster.
 * - **A root that does not contain the enterprise** — refused. The block's
 *   cited paths render relative to the root, and a root that does not hold
 *   the enterprise would bake lies into the node's standing instruction.
 * - **An empty roster** — refused. An enterprise with no offices installs
 *   nothing, and an install that does nothing must say so rather than
 *   succeed.
 * - **A torn marker pair** — refused. One marker without the other is a
 *   contradiction in the node's own record of itself.
 * - **A sibling installer failure** — fatal, stderr shown, the offices
 *   already installed left recorded so clean can sweep them. No partial
 *   success is reported as success.
 * - **A roster record yielding no sentence; a cited instrument seating
 *   nowhere** — refused. The block is a projection, and a projection that
 *   fabricates or cites what does not exist is a lie in the node's
 *   standing instruction.
 *
 * The question is always asked of the enterprise's pools, never of the
 * seated files: CLAUDE.md between the markers and .claude/agents/ are
 * output. Hand-editing them cannot provoke a refusal — reinstalling over
 * the edit is the correction, which is why the edit belongs in the record.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not for seating one office — that is installing-claude-as-an-office
 *   (the identity a session steps into) or installing-claude-as-an-agent
 *   (one colleague a session delegates to).
 * - Not for authoring offices, duties, or skills — this installs what
 *   already exists.
 * - Not for editing the standing block. It is output: change the
 *   enterprise's records and reinstall.
