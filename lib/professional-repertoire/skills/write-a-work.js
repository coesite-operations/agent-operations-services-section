/**
 * @description Writes a work record from data, validating it against work.schema.json and refusing every unmet precondition; amends a seated work to a changed schema with --amend; and with --check validates every seated work, exiting non-zero on any that does not conform, and non-zero on an empty sweep. Use when seating a new work, amending one to a changed schema, or proving the works pool still says what it claims.
 * @throws {Error} the work does not already exist, unless amending, in which case it must
 * @throws {Error} the data conforms to work.schema.json as it is on disk right now
 * @throws {Error} the id equals the record's own basename
 *
 * Assumes work.schema.json is seated in the schema pool and parses. On a
 * successful write, the work exists and reads back clean against the schema
 * on disk, and no work that failed its read-back remains on disk.
 *
 * Design: lib/emsenn/services/561-group/services/board-of-directors/services/executive-office/content/documents/lld-commission-write-a-duty-and-write-a-work.md
 * (reviewed by senior-software-engineer, verdict PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS, both
 * conditions discharged on the record before this file was written). Sibling:
 * write-a-duty.js, which this file mirrors verbatim in shape. The one
 * structural difference: work.schema.json's `needs` field declares no
 * resolution obligation (its own $comment never says a `needs` entry must
 * resolve to a skill, unlike duty.schema.json's `skills`), and the seated
 * pool bears this out — some `needs` entries name seated skill ids, others
 * name bare capability phrases. Guessing which is which would be exactly the
 * shape-guessing read-a-schema.js itself refuses to do, so REFERENCE_POOLS is
 * empty here: `needs` is read, never checked against a pool.
 *
 * The schema is loaded at RUNTIME and is the only authority on shape.
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * node .../write-a-work.js --check      # validate every seated work
 * echo '{...}' | node .../write-a-work.js
 * echo '{...}' | node .../write-a-work.js --amend
 * ```
 *
 * `--from` (default: the caller's working directory) is where the works pool
 * is asked for; only where that walk finds nothing does resolution walk up
 * from this script's own file location before refusing.
 *
 * Input is JSON. Output is JSON. Neither is ever prose.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why that is the skill
 *
 * A work that already exists, refused and never overwritten. A record that
 * fails its own read-back, withdrawn rather than left seated. An empty
 * --check sweep, because a checker that finds nothing and reports success is
 * worse than none — it reads as proof.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not for editing work.schema.json — the schema is the contract this discharges.
 * - Not for a duty record — that is write-a-duty.js.
