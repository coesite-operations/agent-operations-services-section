/**
 * @description Writes a duty record from data, validating it against duty.schema.json and refusing every unmet precondition; amends a seated duty to a changed schema with --amend; and with --check validates every seated duty, exiting non-zero on any that does not conform, and non-zero on an empty sweep. Use when seating a new duty, amending one to a changed schema, or proving the duties pool still says what it claims.
 * @throws {Error} the duty does not already exist, unless amending, in which case it must
 * @throws {Error} the data conforms to duty.schema.json as it is on disk right now
 * @throws {Error} every reference the duty makes (authority, work, claim, skills) resolves from where the duty stands, except the literal "emsenn", which always resolves as the enterprise itself
 *
 * Assumes duty.schema.json is seated in the schema pool and parses. On a
 * successful write, the duty exists and reads back clean against the schema
 * on disk, and no duty that failed its read-back remains on disk.
 *
 * Design: lib/emsenn/services/561-group/services/board-of-directors/services/executive-office/content/documents/lld-commission-write-a-duty-and-write-a-work.md
 * (reviewed by senior-software-engineer, verdict PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS, both
 * conditions discharged on the record before this file was written). Sibling:
 * write-a-work.js. Both mirror write-an-office.js's pattern — the same
 * resolution primitives, the same read-a-schema.js validation, never a
 * private copy of it — with the frontmatter and reciprocal-edge layers
 * removed: every seated duty is a plain JSON instance, and duty.schema.json
 * declares no reciprocal edge for this script to patch.
 *
 * The schema is loaded at RUNTIME and is the only authority on shape — this
 * script hardcodes no field names beyond the residual obligations the schema
 * explicitly delegates to it (id-equals-basename, reference resolution).
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * node .../write-a-duty.js --check      # validate every seated duty
 * echo '{...}' | node .../write-a-duty.js
 * echo '{...}' | node .../write-a-duty.js --amend
 * ```
 *
 * `--from` (default: the caller's working directory) is where the duties pool
 * is asked for; only where that walk finds nothing does resolution walk up
 * from this script's own file location before refusing — a bare invocation
 * standing above the unit's pool, such as the repository root, still finds
 * the management pool this script is seated beside.
 *
 * Input is JSON. Output is JSON. Neither is ever prose, because a record an
 * LLM types is a record nothing checked.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why that is the skill
 *
 * A duty that already exists, refused and never overwritten. A reference
 * (authority, work, claim, or a skill) resolving to nothing, refused before
 * writing — except the literal "emsenn", which names the enterprise itself
 * and never an office record, mirroring how write-an-office.js exempts
 * part-of. A true tie between two equally-near seats, refused with both
 * named. A record that fails its own read-back, withdrawn rather than left
 * seated. An empty --check sweep, because a checker that finds nothing and
 * reports success is worse than none — it reads as proof.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not for editing duty.schema.json — the schema is the contract this discharges.
 * - Not for a task raised against a duty — that is making-a-task.
 * - Not for a work record — that is write-a-work.js.
